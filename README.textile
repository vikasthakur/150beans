h1. 150Beans: a dead simple spending tracker

150Beans is a beans-counting... err... spending tracker application designed with a simple Twitter-esque transaction entry UI. The app parses and extracts transaction details from the free-form text as follows:
* tags: keywords marked by the '#' hashtag
* locations: locations marked by the '@' symbol
* date:
** today: 'now', 'today', <none>
** yesterday: 'yesterday', 'yes'
** N days before today: '^-N' (ie. ^-1 = yesterday, ^-3 = 3 days ago, ^-7 = a week ago today)
** specified date (format y-m-d): July 8, 2011 = 2011/7/8 = 2011/07/08 = 2011-7-8 = 2011-07-08
** specified date (format m-d) - defaults to current year: July 8, 2011 = 7/8 = 7-8
* amount:
** transaction amount prefixed by currency symbol or code: $22.78 = usd 22.78 = usd22.78 = USD22.78
** transaction amount postfixed by currency code: 22.78 usd = 22.78usd = 22.78USD
** transaction amount in format xxxx.xx with no currency markers: 22.78
** known currency symbols and codes:
*** USD ($), GBP(£), EURO(€), CNY(¥), HKD, CAD
*** RMB aliased to CNY
*** defaults to CNY
